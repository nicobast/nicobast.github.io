This seminar combines theoretical and application aspects. Medical students learn the key aspects of psychopathology in children and adolescents and how to assess it. We learn basic skills in patient exploration and explore the key dimensions of psychopathology. In a first step, this is trained and in a second step, this is applied to actual patients.
