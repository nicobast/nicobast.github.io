I am postdoctoral researcher at the [Goethe University Frankfurt](https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/en) (Germany) and Head of Clinical Research at the [Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry](https://www.kgu.de/einrichtungen/kliniken/zentrum-fuer-psychische-gesundheit/psychiatrie-psychosomatik-und-psychotherapie-des-kindes-und-jugendalters) at the Goethe University Hospital. I am licensed as a psychotherapist and conduct cognitive-behavioral treatments in children and adolescents. My research focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental conditions and general psychopathology. My methodological work emphasizes the application of pupillometry as a scalable neuroimaging tool in young and clincial populations. This aims to bridge the gap between developmental neuroscience and clinical application.

Sometimes, I go out for a walk.

My PhD. was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dr. Tobias Banaschewski](https://www.zi-mannheim.de/en/research/people/person/48.html) at the Central Institute of Mental Health and explored eye tracking as a diagnostic tool in autism-spectrum-condition. I am affiliated with the largest European research consortium on autism ([AIMS-2-TRIALS](https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/)), which shaped my interest in collaborative and interdisciplinary research efforts. I received a Master in "Developmental and Clinical Psychology" (2013) and Bachelor in Psychology (2010) from the Heidelberg University with research stays at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Develeopment](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) (group of Gerd Gigerenzer) and [Center for Behavioral Decision Research](https://www.cmu.edu/cbdr/people/index.html) (group of George Loewenstein).
