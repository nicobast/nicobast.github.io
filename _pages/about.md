**Due to university clinic IT shutdown, currently use my Uni email for contact: nbast@med.uni-frankfurt.de**

<p>
I am an independent research group leader (MIND-CHILD lab) funded by the [Emmy Noether Programme](https://www.dfg.de/en/research-funding/funding-opportunities/programmes/individual/emmy-noether) and Head of Clinical Research at the [Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry](https://www.unimedizin-ffm.de/einrichtungen/kliniken/zentrum-fuer-psychische-gesundheit/psychiatrie-psychosomatik-und-psychotherapie-des-kindes-und-jugendalters) at the Goethe University Hospital. I further am a licensed psychotherapist and conduct cognitive-behavioral treatments in children. My research focuses on the neurobiological mechanisms of neurodevelopmental conditions and general psychopathology. My work emphasizes the application of pupillometry as a scalable neuroimaging tool in young and clincial populations. This aims to bridge the gap between developmental neuroscience and clinical application. I envision a future in which we can utilize pupillometry as an early marker to guide prevention strategies that strengthen lifetime mental health.

Sometimes, I go out for a walk.

My PhD. was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Dr. Tobias Banaschewski](https://www.zi-mannheim.de/en/research/people/person/48.html) at the Central Institute of Mental Health and explored eye tracking as a diagnostic tool in neurodiversity. I am affiliated with the largest European research consortium on autism ([AIMS-2-TRIALS](https://www.aims-2-trials.eu/)), which shaped my interest in collaborative and interdisciplinary research. I received a Master in "Developmental and Clinical Psychology" (2013) and Bachelor in Psychology (2010) from the Heidelberg University with research stays at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Develeopment](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) (Gerd Gigerenzer) and [Center for Behavioral Decision Research](https://www.cmu.edu/cbdr/people/index.html) (George Loewenstein).
